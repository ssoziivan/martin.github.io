                <p class="text">
                  Today most people don’t like making appointments over the phone and having an app allows to book an appointment
                  easily online and it provides a virtual office that is open 24×7 and 365 days of a year, with no vacations, or

                </p>
              </li>

              <li>Fewer Missed Appointments:
                <p class="text">
                  Life is quite busy for people and with a lot going on in lives, it gets hard to keep track of all the
                  appointments, and the artist booking app allows the artists to keep track of the booked appointment by saving
                  them in the app calendar as well as constant alerts are sent to them about the upcoming events, so that everything 
                  stays in place. Also, the app allows you to decide your cancellation policy, hence if any client tries canceling 
                  within the cancelation policy time frame, they know they will face a cancellation fee. Also with an app for booking,
                  it is easier to reschedule as the clients have access to your schedule and this allows them to find a time slot that
                  works with their busy schedule.
                </p>
              </li>

                  information regarding the fees. This way clients can easily book the artists as per their convenience and requirements.
                  
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>Ensures Security:
                <p class="text">
                  As it comes to Artist booking mobile app, privacy is an important factor desired by the app owner as well as the
                  clients. And an online Artist booking system ensures that completely by offering immense security for both the app
                  owns and clients. Hence, there is no longer the need for relying on an archaic paper system for tracking client’s information,
                  and no worries if that paper is lost or if the computer is crashing. Today’s systems are in the cloud and this
                  means that any and all kinds of information can be accessed at any time and from any part of the world.

                </p>
              </li>
              <li>Saves Money:

                  expenses can be saved and this way many other such expenses that you otherwise incur if you physically visit the
                  artist to book them for the event.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>No need to rely on Assistants:
                <p class="text">
                  It is good to have assistants to help a lot of work, but at the end of the day, they are human and human makes
                  mistakes, they get sick, and when training a new assistant, they also take some time for learning a new system.
                  However, when artists are booked online via an app, there is no need for making calls. They can be easily booked
                  via the app, and also get access to all the information on the app platform. This way the booking process can
                  entirely be handled by the app.

              Eddy Kenzo has been active for just over ten years but his numbers and achievements, compared to those who
              came before him, rate him way above the rest of the pack of Ugandan entertainers.

              Hit songs, top awards, performing on the biggest stages, massive fan base, admirable lifestyle and now
              the latest addition to all these achievements is that Eddy Kenzo has also become the first active Ugandan
              musician to make 1 million Instagram followers.

              Apart from the music that effortlessly attracts the fans, he has often made skits, challenges and other
              funny posts that entice several people to hit the like/follow/subscribe buttons.

                Singer Juliana Kanyomozi has been out of the limelight for quite a while since she had gone into hibernation to
                give birth to her mystery baby who the world only got to know about, only after he was born.

                Juliana took up the 'Artist of the Year' accolade at the Pearl of Africa Music Awards. She was the first female
                musician to take that award from Uganda. Besides giving her fans great music, Juliana is also an actress who made her
                film debut in Henry' Ssali's Kiwani: The Movie. 

                Over the years she has won so many awards for her brilliant work and has been nominated a number of times.
                She is forever thankful for making the brave decision of quitting the airwaves to join the music industry where she
                ended up also realizing her lifetime goals.
